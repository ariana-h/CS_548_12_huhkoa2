## Getting the dataset
The facades dataset that is curated for the Pix2Pix model is located in the Assign02 directory under Facades. This dataset is used to run both Assign02 code and Assign03 scripts. The A03_data.py script has a path to the dataset in the Assign02/Facades directory and uses the the A/train building facade images.

The original dataset that was used for CycleGAN was taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balraj98/facades-dataset but has since been modified for Pix2Pix.
